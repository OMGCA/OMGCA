## About me
Hello, I'm Tian 'Sebastian' Xia, a.k.a. OMGCA, the alias I've been using since 2007. I'm currently working for Arashi Vision (a.k.a. Insta360), responsible for basic application experience on HarmonyOS platform. Previously I worked for Huawei, mainly focusing on the Wallpaper framework and experience of HarmonyOS NEXT, Data Communication products' OS platform and the Performance Lab in Nvidia. Alma mater University of York, BEng, MSc.

## Me on GitHub
I'm not very active on GitHub as I barely have much time devoting on my own project, although I very much want to. I use it more as my code repos' back up, as you can see most of my projects are way back to 2018. My star page is definitely much more interesting than my own project page.

For those who found this page, I thank you for your visit.
